    <h1>B.Sc in Computer Applications</h1>

    <div>
        <p>The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving, an essential skill for life. Students study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business, scientific and social contexts. In line with globalization and the borderless world, the computer is a machine in the information society acting as the main artery of all machinery administration in any field.p>

        <p>Application of computer at every technological area and management is must. Every technological and social research is not possible without computer application. Data transmission and application for the planning and administration is incomplete without computer application. Government is also planning its administration system in the e-Governance for the efficient governing. As per the survey there are huge shortfalls of manpower in the computer application field. This course is aim to fulfill this gap and create new opportunities for the students.</p>

        <p>You can pursue Masters Degree in the same field and select one or more area of operation as per your choice. You can also pursue the post graduation in the field of Computer Application with various specialized area. Candidates having secured an aggregate of 50% in science and 50% in Maths in Intermediate Science from JAC/ICSE/CBSE or any other recognized board are eligible. The selection of the candidates will be made on the basis of the marks secured in the Entrance Test followed by Interview, to be notified on the college notice board/college website.</p>
