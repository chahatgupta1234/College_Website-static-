    <h1>B.Sc in Physics</h1>

    <div>
        <p>The Department of Physics started B.Sc. pass course in 1947. The department has faculty with interests ranging from experimental to theoretical aspects of condensed matter physics, optics, spectroscopy, image processing, field theory and quantum computation. The present faculty members are highly dedicated for quality physics education with innovative methods of theory teaching and practices; and inspiring and guiding laboratory classes. The faculty and students in the department are cooperatively contributing towards the advancement of scientific knowledge at the frontiers of human understanding of sciences, in general, and physics in particular. This process essentially intertwines the basic development of scientific temperament in the classroom, laboratory instruction activities within the department in conjunction with the Central Research Laboratory of the college and dissemination through professional channels in the classroom.</p>

        <p>The Department of Physics, St. Xavierâ€™s College, Ranchi, will be a national leader in the integration of (i) teaching and learning, (ii) advancement of the knowledge base through research and scholarship, and (iii) leadership in service to mankind and outreach. Further, the Department will be a national leader in preparing young motivated and enlightened individuals who will be providing leadership in creating a working and learning environment that supports research as integral to learning, thinking, and advancing knowledge, within any institution of the world, they associate themselves with.</p>

        <p>The Department of Physics is committed to excellence in the education of its undergraduate students in core as well as related areas that encompass understanding of physical concepts, the generation and dissemination of new scientific knowledge involving physical principles and their applications. Its objective is to have a beneficial impact on the society and nation at large, while enhancing the quality of teaching and research. The mission of the department is to provide student-centered education, with emphases on quality teaching, student-faculty research, scholarly activity, service, and maintaining an active and congenial atmosphere for teaching and learning, in which faculty members set a high priority in teaching and strive to build a caring and learning environment for students.</p>
