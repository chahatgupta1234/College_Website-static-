    <h1>B.A. in Hindi</h1>

    <div>
        <p>The Hindi Dept. along with its academic programme conduct its cultural programmes. Hindi is our national language and it is spoken and understood by majority of Indians. It is also helpful in marketing, public relations and other jobs. Keeping these in mind we organize at least one monthly intra-college event related to the language like poetry-recitation, essay-writing, debates etc. This helps in brushing and polishing of young talents in the college and also gives them a chance to express their views through their literary works.</p>

        <p>The Department offers a B.A. (Honours) programme in Hindi and M.A. (Hindi) under Choice Based Credit System.</p>

        <p>The selection of the candidates will be made on the basis of Entrance Test & Interview. </p>
